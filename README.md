# COVID-19 Vaccination Trends Visualizer: Canada vs United States

## Description
This project uses pandas and matplotlib to visualize COVID-19 vaccination trends in Canada and the United States in a neat, visually appealing graph. Using publicly available data from Our World in Data, it compares the percentage of the population to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 over time. 

## Features
- Colourful line graphs showing vaccination trends for each country.
- Uses Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `matplotlib.dates`. 
- Custom date formatting for clean, professional visualization of healthcare data.

## Data Source

## Acknowledgment 
This project was done entirely as a learning exercise to strengthen my personal experience with matplotlib and panda. I adapted and customized example code to suit the dataset and build my understanding of data visualization and statistics.
